Introduction
This project is a simple web page for BAB International, allowing users to search for Quran verses in English. It includes a mock login page and search functionality.

Features
- Mock Login Page: Use "admin" and "123" as credentials.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
   
   git clone <repository-link>
   
2. Open index.html: Access the mock login page. After a successful login, you will be redirected to the search page.

3. Open search.html: Search for Quran verses by entering keywords.

Challenges
- Firebase Integration: Integrating Firebase for authentication was challenging, so a mock login was implemented instead.
- Dynamic Search: Implementing semantic search with Qdrant was complex and remains incomplete.
